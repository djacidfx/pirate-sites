# Pirate Sites
A list of pirate sites because, why not?! I'm not telling you to pirate but, I'm telling you this is for educational use only, what you do with it is on you fro this point forward

Recently I've had a bunch of the blue haired kids from here on GitHub send hundreds of people to make fake reports to my google dev account to have it shut down, for now... They seem to have a sore ass over what was said to them so since doing things the right way has resulted in a small time dev being harassed, I will be more than happy to provide links to pirate sites I find

 - [Codelist](https://codelist.cc) - Paid PHP Scripts, Mobile Source code and more
 - [PSD Keys](https://psdkeys.com/) A graphic designers place
 - [VFX Download](https://vfxdownload.net/) Game Engine Assets
 - [Desire](https://desirefx.me/) A lot of different types of free files
 - [GFX Hub](https://gfx-hub.cc/)
 - More to come!

If you would like to add something to the list please, feel free to do so!
